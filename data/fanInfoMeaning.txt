					

MethodJson --- The json history file of the method of interest

        
MethodSignature --- Fully Qaulified Signature

FanInJsons     --- Json history files of methods that called the method of interest. NoCall means no one called. null means, we could not find the json history file for this caller method (
The method existed two years ago, but does not exist now as one of the reasons.)


FanInSignatures --- Qualified Signatures of the caller methods. 

Accurate? --- No means there is atleast one caller method that we could not resolve the fully qualified signature, so we don't have it's CodeShovel history (we will discard the complete row). 
 
DiscardDays --- We discard any change (e.g., revision, diff) upto this day.
